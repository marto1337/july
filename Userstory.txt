  - function to allow data from the user to be stored in variables;
  - customizing the .html generating function so that it OBEYS THE USER'S WILL!;

2. Number generator.
  - function that can generate a random number every time;
  - option to choose the minimal and maximal number to generate;
  
3. Function to generate random equations.
  - easy customization of how large number to be used;
  - verification that a != 0, since devision by 0 is undefined;
  - verification that x1 and x2 will be integers, so that the solution
                                            does not require a calculator;

4. Function to solve the equations.
  - finding the discriminant;
  - finding x depending on the 3 possible cases:
                                    - 2 real solutions
                                      - only 1 solution
                                        - no solution;
